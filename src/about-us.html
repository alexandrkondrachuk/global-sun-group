                                        experiences with our services. You provide some of this data directly, such as
                                        when you create a personal account. We get some of it by recording how you
                                        interact with our services by, for example, using technologies like cookies, and
                                        receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device. We
                                        also obtain data from third parties (including other companies). For example, we
                                        supplement the data we collect by purchasing demographic data from other
                                        companies. We also use services from other companies to help us determine a
                                        location based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your
                                        location. The data we collect depends on the services and features you use.</p>

                                    <p>Our web site uses the data we collect for three basic purposes: to operate our
                                        business and provide (including improving and personalizing) the services we
                                        offer, to send communications, including promotional communications, and to
                                        display advertising. In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect
                                        through the various web site services you use to give you a more seamless,
                                        consistent and personalized experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have
                                        built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain
                                        data combinations. For example, we store data we collect from you when you are
                                        unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that
                                        directly identifies you, such as your name, email address or phone number.</p>

                                        When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data

                                        financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. In

                                        securing our systems and services may need access to personal data in order to
                                        provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our data
                                        privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they
                                        receive from us for any other purpose. We may also disclose personal data as
